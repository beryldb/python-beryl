## QuickStart

The quick start guide will show you how to set up a simple application using
BerylDB's Python driver.

It scope is only how to set up the driver and perform the simple operations.
For more advanced coverage, we encourage reading our tutorial.

## Connecting to BerylDB

Let's create a new **example.py** file that we will be using to show
basic operations. First, we need to add code to conenct to the remote
server:

```python
async def main():
  link = Client(host='127.0.0.1', port=6378, login='root', password='default')
  await link.connection(Connection.Server)
```

If you are familiar with BerylDB, you will soon learn that most functions
from this driver have the same name as its underlying function. 

Check BerylDB's [full list of commands](https://docs.beryl.dev/commands/)

## Querying

Let's look at an example exercising all the different available operations.

We define a key **``hello``** with value **world**

```python
try:
    print (await link.set("hello", "world"))
except Exception as error:     
    print(error.message)
```

Let's try setting a map

```python
try:
    print (await link.hset("a", "b", "c"))
except Exception as error:     
    print(error.message)
```

These two code will have the following output (assuming that neither 'hello'
or 'a' are defined):

```
OK
```

In BerylDB, different structues cannot hold the same variable name. In order
to check what kind of data structure is a given key, you may use type

```python
print (await link.type("a")) # Key
```

## Querying for lists

You can use forEach in order to iterate a result that contains more than one
item:

```python
try:
    for item in (await link.keys("*")):
       print(item)
except Exception as error:     
    print(error.message)
```

Assuming that keys **``a``** and **``b``** are defined, this code will have the following output

```
a
b
```
